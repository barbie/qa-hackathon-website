        <div class="contentbox-noshading">
          <p>The <strong>QA Hackathon</strong> website is hosted by <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org" title="Birmingham Perl Mongers">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a>. The site is intended to be used as a holding place for links and news of forthcoming <strong>QA Hackathons</strong>. While the events are not decided by committee, if you wish to co-ordinate your efforts to ensure others are not planning a <strong>QA Hackathon</strong> at the same time, feel free to <a href="/contact.html" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> to see whether a domain has been requested.</p>

				<div class="contentbox-title-shading">A Little History</div>
        <div class="contentbox-noshading">
          <p>The first <strong>QA Hackathon</strong> event in 2008 was organised by the <em><strong>Oslo Perl Mongers</strong></em> in Norway, lead by <em>Salve J Nielsen</em>, following some very successful <em>Nordic Perl Workshops</em>. The event came about due to a desire to get some movement on the TAP specification for submission to the IETF. With 2 large QA/Open Source conferences also happening in Norway the following week, these were considered to be good incentives to attract some notable QA and Testing hackers to come along, and dedicate a weekend to working on various projects. The event was a huge success and started the foundation for several new projects.</p>
          
          <p>After the 2008 hackathon, several attendees expressed a desire for the event to happen again. However, no-one had any idea where or when. After reading the reports and reviews, having not been able to attend, <em>JJ</em> &amp; <em>Barbie</em> of <em><strong>Birmingham Perl Mongers</strong></em>, put forward the idea to the other members of the user group of hosting an event for 2009. Birmingham Perl Mongers had become incorporated in 2006, enabling them to host the <em>2006 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference</em>, and had sufficient funds to host a <strong>QA Hackathon</strong>. The user group members voted unanimously to support the event, and at the 2008 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, it was announced that Birmingham would host the 2009 <strong>QA Hackathon</strong>. Once again the event proved extremely successful and featured many improvements to several TAP, Testing and toolchain projects, resulting in a very strong feeling that the event should be an annual occurance.</p>

          <p>In 2010, <em><strong>Vienna Perl Mongers</strong></em>, who had previously organised the <em>2007 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference</em>, announced that they would like to host the event. The event took place in Vienna, 10-12 April, and was just as successful as the first two <strong>QA Hackathons</strong>. <code>brian d foy</code> posted some videos of the event, capturing the summaries for <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2010/04/2010-vienna-qa-workshop-day-1-results-video.html" title="Day 1 video">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2010/04/2010-vienna-qa-workshop-day-2-results-video.html" title="Day 2 video">Day 2</a> and <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2010/04/2010-vienna-qa-workshop-final-summary-video.html" title="Day 3 video">Day 3</a>.</p>
          
          <p>For 2011, the event was held in Amsterdam, at the offices of principal sponsor Booking.com. As with previous years, there was a lot of interest in the event, and just as much productivity come out of it. In a reflective moment, Mark Keating (Shadowcat's MDK), <a href="http://mdk.per.ly/2011/04/17/a-meeting-of-many-camels/" title="A Meeting Of Many Camels">posted the following on his blog</a>. It highlights the value and importance of this annual event:</p>

          <blockquote>
          While I have been conducting the interviews and talking to people a few thoughts have come out of what we have discussed,  part of this is the real impact of what is being achieved here is really hard to quantify with a few simple words especially in regards to a direct product/cost relationship yet what they are working on affects a great number of projects, libraries and modules and the whole ethos of quality assurance is to instill reliability. When we consider that there are circa-30 experienced developers sat together in a room for 3 days for a total event cost of less than 10K in Euros (where the prospective cost of employing these people for 90 man days of work is easily eight to ten times that cost) it isn't just a worthwhile endeavour it is a feat of brilliance.
          </blockquote>

          <p>The enthusiam about the QA Hackathon was now so great, that during the 2011 event, two potential hosts stepped forward to organise the next event. After a gentlemen's agreement, the Paris crew agreed to host the 2012, with the London crew planning the 2013 (though more of that in a moment). 2012 took place thats to the support of Les Mongueurs de Perl, in Paris, France. The event was very well attended once again, and was held in the building known as La Cit&eacute; des Sciences et de l'Industrie (The City of Science and Industry), surrounded by exhibits, artifacts and sculptures, providing a very innovative setting.</p>

          <p>We already knew 2013 was to take place in the UK, but due to circumstances, the location moved from London to Lancaster in the North of England. A historic city and proved to be a good choice for the event. The hackathon itself was held in the new InfoLab21 building on the Lancaster University campus. ShadowCat, the primary sponsors, organised the event, and looked after everyone. However, that wasn't all. As Miyagawa wasn't able to make the event in Lancaster, he and other notable Japanese developers, organised a satellite event in Tokyo, which was equally successful, producing just as much development output as the Lancaster event. With the success of the Tokyo Satellite event, hopefully we'll more in the future for those unable to attend the main event.</p>

          <p>During the 2013 event, BooK, eager to organise another event, suggested Lyon host the event for 2014. We may also have a suggestion for the 2015 event, but we'll have to see whether those who could potentially organise the event are available. Stay tuned for more news.</p>
